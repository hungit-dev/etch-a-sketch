# Etch-a-Sketch-
-This is a hard project. I spent approximately 6 hours to figure ways to do it and 2 hours for polishing it. After doing this project, my skills with DOM and javascript has improved significantly. I got to know more about how to use addEventListener such as "mouseEvent" and "clickEvent". But of course, I'm still lacking of planning ahead and the structure of my code is not perfect yet!!!
BUT PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT
